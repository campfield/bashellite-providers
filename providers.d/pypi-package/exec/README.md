#Executable files

This directory contains any executable files generated by the provider's `install_provider.sh` script that can/should not be installed globally in `/usr/local/bin`. This usually includes binaries that reside in a python/ruby virtualenv, or something similar.

Once installed, these binaries and/or executable scripts are typically not part of the `bashellite` user's PATH, and are called explicitly, by a function in the provider's `provider_wrapper.sh` script, which in turn is sourced by the `bashellite` command-line utility itself.

Note: not all providers are installed in this way, so this directory may be blank; check the `install_provider.sh` to determine this provider's installation method and location.
